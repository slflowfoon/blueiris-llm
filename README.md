# blueiris-llm

## How It Works
1. When a camera is alerted, Blue Iris writes the path to the most recent alert image on the camera to `latest.txt`
2. It then runs the `run.bat` script which reads the value of the `img_path` from `latest.txt` and runs the Python script using the most recent `img_path`
3. After the LLM responds, the Python script extracts the response from the JSON to `response.txt`
4. Blue Iris then sends the response in the body of the notification by using the additional special macros

----

The way that I run this is by placing the following 2 files in a folder named after the camera, for example, `C:\Users\MyUser\Documents\Blue Iris\Driveway\`:
* `__init__.py`
* `run.bat`

1. In Blue Iris, create the following action on alert:
  * **Action:** `Write to file--replace`
  * **File:** `C:\Users\MyUser\Documents\Blue Iris\Driveway\latest.txt`
  * **Parameters:** `D:\Alerts\&ALERT_PATH`
  * **Camera:** Choose the camera your are setting up

2. Create another action on alert:
  * **Action:** Run program/script
  * **File:** `C:\Users\MyUser\Documents\Blue Iris\Driveway\run.bat`

3. Create a delay of 5000msec to give the script and the LLM enough time to respond.

4. Create your push notification:
  * **Body:** `%1`

5. Within **Blue Iris Settings** > **Macros**, we'll setup `%1` to the `response.txt` file generated by the script.
  * `file://C:\Users\MyUser\Documents\Blue Iris\Driveway\response.txt`
